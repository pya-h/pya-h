# 👨‍💻 Paya | @pya-h

Full-stack developer with a sharp focus on backend systems, decentralization, and developer autonomy. I build reliable software from scratch — from SQL to smart contracts — with a strong bias toward low-level control and simplicity.
Experienced also in Desktop App, Console App, Mobile App development and Also in some other platform/frameworks.

## 🛠️ Tech Focus

- **Languages**: Rust, Go, TypeScript, PHP, SQL
- **Frameworks**: NestJS, TypeORM, Prisma, Hono, Bootstrap, React
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Gnosis, UMA, Solana (Anchor), Ethereum JSON-RPC
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Other Tools**: MinIO, Docker, VS Code, Git

## 🧠 Projects & Interests

### 🗳️ Prediction Markets
- Built decentralized prediction markets using **Gnosis FPMM** & **UMA Oracles**
- Designed both centralized and decentralized backends using **NestJS** and **PostgreSQL**
- Custom block analyzers to track deposits using **Ethereum RPC** every 10 seconds

### 📬 Crypto Telegram Bot
- Price alerts, token conversions, and portfolio tracking
- Pure **Python**, no ORM — direct **MySQL** for full control

### 🗳️ Decentralized Prediction Market
- Backend for a decentralized prediction market using **Gnosis FPMM** and **UMA oracles**.
- Includes a **custom block analyzer** module to detect deposits using **Ethereum JSON-RPC**.
- Built with **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, **TypeORM**, and deployed on testnets (Sepolia).

### 🧠 Tic-Tac-Toe 3D Online
- Experimental Online 3D Tic Tac Toe game
- Lots of features, different types of games with both AI and online rivals.
- Integrated a Minimal social section, enabling players to chat and make friends with eachother, with proper realtime chatting and notification system.
- Leaderboards, point system and other stuff.

### 🎮 Game Dev & Reverse Engineering
- Works with **C/C++**, **Go**, and **Rust** for performance-sensitive applications
- Obsessed with writing console based games written in C/C++

## 🧠 Currently Working On
- Solana blockchain
- Interpretter/Compiler Design & Implemnetation
- Exploitation Tools & Methods
- Learning zig programming language
- Improving C/Rust/Go skills
  
## 📚 Philosophy

I’m drawn to existential themes, complexity without chaos, and structured minimalism — in both software and life. My favorite authors include **Camus**, **Orwell**, and **Bulgakov**. I build things that matter, learn what I must, and discard what I don't need.
I prefer expressive, low-abstraction code and work best when I'm close to the metal — from raw SQL queries to direct RPC calls. I read **Camus**, write Rust, and often build tools before using them.
